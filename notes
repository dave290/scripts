# How to call sh files that exist in the Scripts folder from the home shell

$ cd
$ export PATH=$PATH:/home/david/Scripts
$ echo $PATH
write bash script and append .sh	hiya.sh
make this executable using          	chmod u+x hiya.sh
call this using                     	hiya.sh OR ./hiya.sh dave OR bash hiya.sh dave
from now on, call by			hiya.sh typeanamehere

Also
from the Scripts directory, call the program with $ ./test.sh
to run this shell script from any directory, add the folder to the .bashrc file
then, from home directory, enter $ source .bashrc
should be able to call the script using $ test.sh

Or
Add the .sh file to the /.local/bin folder in the home directory
This will keep the file in the path always, after every startup

For example, on the gr-radio_astro OS:
Copy the executable shell script, go.sh into the folder 
/home/pi/.local/bin
From now on, when I enter $ go.sh, it will start the data collection programs.

#TODO
#is there a way to make the python script read and write to working directory 
#from which the shell script was called?
#or, do I need to create a dedicated directory for using files?
#or, have a list of directories to search?
